Call me Heein Park.

I usually script codes with Javascript to establish front-end architecture since Vanilla-script.
Everyone said it was a primitive web "scripting" language. Hence I had to move on to other languages for future projects.
It was valid advice, yet now Node JS and its apostles have lurked into many areas of development.
When I explore several information technologies, there are always somebodies who built frameworks coded with ECMAScript 6 anyhow.

You and I cannot escape from that "scripting" language, even with some drawbacks compared to other languages.

The words above are my excuse for not mastering Python, Java, and C series. They are indeed decent languages.
But the Javascript evil-lings do not let me proceed.
